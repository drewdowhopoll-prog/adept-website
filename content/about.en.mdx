ADEPT is a Marseille-based association focused on Transmediums practices. We explore the frictions between techniques and supports—materials, tools, processes—to make works and situations that overflow categories.

ADEPT operates through three lines: programming (events, performances, screenings), artist support (production, networking, residencies), and a gallery (presentation and sale of unique works and editions).

We collaborate with diverse artists, venues and publics, favoring sober formats, economical means and attention to context. "Transmediums" is our neologism: working across and between mediums understood as means of production.
